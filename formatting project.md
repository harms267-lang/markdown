# Marc Siegel’s Argumentative Strategies to Explain the “Social Media Trap”

In a 2023 guest commentary in [USA Today](link.gale.com/apps/doc/A767713775/OVIC?u=umn_wilson&sid=bookmark-OVIC&xid=1409a7e8), Marc Siegel argues that adolescents are best protected from the dangers of social media by parental supervision. 
The effect of social media on adolescents mental health has been a popular subject of conversation, with multitudes of studies conducted, most confirming that young 
teens mental health and wellbeing decline as social media use rises. Over the past ten years, social media usage has gone up for all age groups, with the amount of 
people on these platforms increasing, as well as the amount of time spent online increasing. Among social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, and Youtube 
are most popular, especially among Gen Z users. Socials have changed significantly over the past ten years, as many had humble beginnings and simpler features.
For example, Facebook used to have a feed feature only, where you saw posts by friends and family; this was long before Facebook was launched in app form. 
Now, Facebook offers more than a feed of friend and follower posts; features such as reels, stories, explore page, and more can be used on Facebook as well as 
Instagram, Tiktok, and Youtube. With more features to explore, along with the progression of data collection and algorithms used to curate user’s feeds to their
liking, teens are susceptible to social media addiction that is largely responsible for high rates of depression and anxiety. There is not a known way to combat this 
effect fully, but Siegel suggests that the best route right now lies in the hands of parents and caregivers.

Siegel starts his argumentative essay with comments from two Republican politicians on the subject of banning TikTok. Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley concur that 
TikTok’s data-stealing mechanics and addictive content are reasons for a ban for adolescents, specifically those younger than 16. While Siegel agrees with Haley and 
Ramaswamy on the dangers of TikTok for young people, he draws a parallel between the possibility of a TikTok ban and alcohol prohibition in the 1920s in terms of ineffectiveness. 
By drawing this parallel, he implicitly points out that a “complete ban” is never safe from loopholes, as Americans in the 1920s illegally made and sold their own liquor
during the prohibition era. A TikTok ban would be nearly impossible to enforce, as children and teens could easily lie about their age or use alternative accounts for easy access.

Siegel relies on logos following his introduction toillustrate the “social media trap” through the use of two statistics. 
Prior to this, he sets up his argument by explaining that social media initially disguises itself as a forum for connection where 
adolescents can feel accepted amongst their peers. This is the element that draws them in at first, backfiring against them once they actually get there. 
He includes U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy’s findings that “one third of girls ages 11 to 15 feel addicted to social media and close to half of adolescents say 
that social media makes them feel bad about their body image” (Siegel pg. 1). This is why Siegel considers social media a trap: it presents itself as beneficial,
but in practice, is harmful to teens' mental health, and discourages them by constantly exposing them to unrealistic standards of perfection; 
and its addictive nature is what keeps teens stuck after initial exposure to socials, thus resembling a “trap.”

After Siegel’s use of logos, he presents us with an ethos-focused solution: parental monitoring as means to alleviate and prevent the negative effects 
of social media on teens. He frames parents as the ultimate example to their children, as children’s behaviors initially stem from parental behaviors and household dynamics.
Parents make mistakes as all people do, after all no one is perfect; however, Siegel wants to bring attention to the fact that subconsciously, children and young teens 
trust their parents, viewing them as the most credible and trustworthy people in their lives. Young children turn to their parents for wisdom and protection, 
and it’s the parent’s responsibility to use their inherent credibility to set a good example for their children by staying off their phone at the dinner table,
interacting with their children and having meaningful conversations with them often, warning them of the dangers of social media and preventing overuse. 
Siegel ultimately argues that proper parental examples surrounding social media and smartphone use is reflected in the behaviors of their children,
who are less likely to be negatively affected by the social media trap. 

Through parallels, logos, and ethos, Siegel crafts a strong, rich argument for parental supervision as the most effective way to prevent teens 
from experiencing social media addiction and exposure to inflammatory content. Bans are generally unsuccessful as they often fuel willpower 
(when there’s a will, there's a way), but stopping the social media trap through parental examples and warnings to young teens about the potential consequences 
is the best way to get to the source of the issue.
