# Learning about Markdown

This is a new paragraph in Markdown.
Markdown is a minimal markup system that is popular with developers
and technical writers. 
Markdown uses formatting conventions taht are borrowed from writing 
files in plain text.

Here's a paragraph just to show that you start a new paragraph by adding one or more blank lines. 

Because it is all plain text. I don't really have a button to make text 
**bold** (2 asterisks)
or _italic_ (1 underscore)
or __bold__ (2 underscores)
or *italic* (1 asterisk)
so i need to imply that formatting using plain text

You can also put bold and italic at the front or end of a word (by a few letters).
For example, *HTML* stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
